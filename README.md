Opti-AWARE 0.4 (Last updated 16/09/2025)
----------

This branch contains the source code for Opti-AWARE, an extension of AWARE and WHEAT/BFT-SMaRt.

*Important:
For evaluation purpose, we suggest to deploy Opti-AWARE in a wide-area network (WAN).*
In the following, we provide a description of how to (1) build, (2) configure, and (3) run this software.

----------

## Step 0: System Assumptions

This tutorial is tested using the following operating system:

```
Description:	Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
Release:	24.04
Linux Kernel: 6.14.0-1012-aws
```

The test system specification for testing functionality is a ``t3.micro`` VM on AWS, but for performance evaluations we recommend ``c5.xlarge`` and above.
Recommended system: More than 20 GB available disk space, 16 GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores.

### Software versions:

```
Java v. 11 (tested with openjdk version "11.0.28" 2025-07-15; build 11.0.28+6-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu124.04.1)
Gradle v 7.1 (output of -version below)

```

Note that these are the versions we tested with, newer version might also work but without guarantee.



## Step 1: Check for Updates (optional)

Check if the version you pulled from an online repo includes all recent changes form the most stable `main` branch from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bergerch/opti-aware). To check for updates it might be a good idea to  clone from the GitHub Repo we will maintain:


```
git clone https://github.com/bergerch/opti-aware.git
```


Now you should have the most recent changes. Next step is to build the software.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

We use Java (v. 11) and Gradle (v 7.1) for this project. If you have them already installed on your computer, then just skip this step otherwise you need to install them. For your convenience you may try the commands below:

### 2.1 Java
```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```
### 2.2 Gradle
```
mkdir .gradle
cd .gradle
wget https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.1-bin.zip
unzip -d . gradle-7.1-bin.zip
```
### 2.3 GCC
```
sudo apt install gcc
```

## Step 3: Compile the Source Code

For the first time, you can execute ``./gradlew`` (this should also install gradle) inside the repository.
```
./gradlew
```
To compile all code, run the ``build`` command (rebuild every time you make changes to ``src``) :
```
./gradlew build
```
To prepare for launching the artifact use the ``installDist`` command:
```
./gradlew installDist
```
This prepares the required jar files and default configuration files to be available in the `build/install/library` directory.



## Step 4: Defining a System Configuration

To run any demonstration you first need to configure Opti-AWARE/BFT-SMaRt to define the protocol behavior and the location of each replica.

The servers must be specified in the configuration file (see `config/hosts.config`):

```
#server id, address and port (the ids from 0 to n-1 are the service replicas) 
0 127.0.0.1 11000 11001
1 127.0.0.1 11010 11011
2 127.0.0.1 11020 11021
3 127.0.0.1 11030 11031
4 127.0.0.1 11040 11041
5 127.0.0.1 11050 11051
6 127.0.0.1 11060 11061
```

**Important tip #1:** Always provide IP addresses instead of hostnames. If a machine running a replica is not correctly configured, BFT-SMaRt may fail to bind to the appropriate IP address and use the loopback address instead (127.0.0.1). This phenomenom may prevent clients and/or replicas from successfully establishing a connection among them.

**Important tip #2:** You may want to specify at least **n=4** replicas.


The system configurations also have to be specified (see `config/system.config`). A working configuration file is included but to understand the parameters we refer the interested reader to the paper.


## Step 5 (optional): Generating Public/Private Key Pairs

If you need to generate public/private keys for more replicas or clients, you can use the following command:

```
./runscripts/smartrun.sh bftsmart.tom.util.RSAKeyPairGenerator <id> <key size>
```

Keys are stored in the `config/keys` folder. The command above creates key pairs both for clients and replicas. 

**Important tip #3:** Alternatively, you can set the `system.communication.defaultkeys` to `true` in the `config/system.config` file to force all processes to use the same public/private keys pair and secret key. This is useful when deploying experiments and benchmarks, because it enables the programmer to avoid generating keys for all principals involved in the system. However, this must not be used in real deployments.


## Step 6: Deployment in a WAN

In this step you deploy the system in a WAN. You can launch several virtual machines in different regions. Note that every VM needs to have Java 11 installed to run the Java Bytecode. You will have to copy the build in
```
build/install/library
```
which also already includes configuration files and keys to every VM (both replicas and clients!).
For instance, we used AWS, 21 regions and `c5.xlarge` for each client and replica in every region. Regions are as outlined in:
```
data/aws/aws-servers.csv
```

Furthermore, note that firewall rules must be configured to allow TCP inbound and outbound traffic on the port range 11000 to 12000, or, the ports you defined yourself in Step 4.

**Important tip #4:** Never forget to delete the `config/currentView` file after you modify `config/hosts.config` or `config/system.config`. If `config/currentView` exists, BFT-SMaRt always fetches the group configuration from this file first. Otherwise, BFT-SMaRt fetches information from the other files and creates `config/currentView` from scratch. 



## Step 7: Running the Replicas


You can run a single instance of a *ThroughputLatencyServer* (a replica used to conduct benchmarks) using the following commands:

```
 cd build/install/library/
```
```
./smartrun.sh bftsmart.demo.microbenchmarks.ThroughputLatencyServer 0 10000 0 0 false nosig
```

Note that you passed the following parameters:

`ThroughputLatencyServer <processId> <measurement interval> <reply size> <state size> <context?> <nosig | default | ecdsa> [rwd | rw]`


**Important tip #5:** If you are getting timeout messages, it is possible that the application you are running takes too long to process the requests or the network delay is too high and PROPOSE messages from the leader does not arrive in time, so replicas may start the leader change protocol. To prevent that, try to increase the `system.totalordermulticast.timeout` parameter in `config/system.config`.


You need to repeat this procedure for all replicas on every VM, and increment the `<processId> ` for every replica. Make sure you use the correct `<processId>` as you defined with the `hosts.conf` in Step 4.


## Step 8: Running the Client(s)

**Important tip #6:** Clients requests should not be issued before all replicas have been properly initialized. Replicas are ready to process client requests when each one outputs `-- Ready to process operations` in the console.

Once all replicas are ready, the client can be launched as follows:

```
 cd build/install/library/
```
```
./smartrun.sh bftsmart.demo.microbenchmarks.ThroughputLatencyClient 1001 1 10000 0 0 false false nosig
```

`ThroughputLatencyClient <initial client id> <number of clients> <number of operations> <request size> <interval (ms)> <read only?> <verbose?> <nosig | default | ecdsa>`

**Important tip #7:** Always make sure that each client uses a unique ID. Otherwise, clients may not be able to complete their operations.

Note that these `bftsmart.benchmark` implementations should also automatically store the results to the file system.

**Important tip #8:** For parsing latency results from all clients from the different regions you may want to use a script after collecting the results. It may look similar to this:
```
cat bftSmartClient{0..20}/bftSmartClient*.java.*.stdout | grep "Average time for 1000 executions (-10%)" | sed 's/Average time for 1000 executions (-10%) = / /g' | sed 's/ \/\/  /, /g' | sed 's/us/ /g' > latencies.csv
```

## Step 9 (optional): Reproduce Results from the Paper

Evaluation results depend on the speed of communication links in the WAN. 
Interestingly, we observed that links may become faster (to some extent) over large time intervals (years) because large cloud providers like Amazon AWS improve their infrastructure. For this purpose we provide latency data that allow an interested person to mimic the network characteristics we used by relying on high-fidelity network emulation/simulation tools like [Kollaps](https://github.com/miguelammatos/Kollaps) and [Shadow](https://github.com/shadow/shadow). 
These latency data can be found in the directories:

For the AWS setup with 21 regions see:
```
data/aws/aws.csv
```

For the wonderproxy setup with 51 regions see:
```
data/wonderproxy/wonderproxy.csv
```
